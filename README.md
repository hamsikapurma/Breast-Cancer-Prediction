# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

This deep learning model is specifically designed to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign based on a comprehensive set of input features. The model is trained using a dataset that includes critical breast cancer characteristics such as tumor size, texture, shape, and other relevant medical attributes.

Leveraging a neural network architecture, the model effectively identifies complex patterns within the data that are indicative of malignant or benign tumors. This classification tool is aimed at supporting healthcare professionals in making accurate and timely breast cancer diagnoses, ultimately contributing to better patient care.

The model is evaluated on validation dataset as well as test dataset showcasing high accuracy and robustness in distinguishing between malignant and benign breast tumors.
